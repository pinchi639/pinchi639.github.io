            <p>Contrast is one of the most powerful design concepts of them all because
                really any design element can be contrasted with another In their website you can see difference in the
                elements. Images on the website also helps acentuate that contrast.They do a good job on differenciating
                important information.</p>

            <p>The principle of proximity is about moving things closer or farther apart to
                achieve a more organized look. In this website the proximity is not very good.
                There are so many little images all together and they don't look good
                and they are very distracting.</p>

            <h1>Parc: Repetition</h1>
            <h2>Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, Family Search</h2>
            <h2><a href="https://www.familysearch.org/en/">Family Search</a></h2>
            <img class="image-size" src="images/family search.jpeg" alt="Family Search">
            <p>The principle of repetition simply means the reusing of the same or similar
                elements throughout your design.In the family seacrh website of you click on the top right you will see
                a
                good
                example. Under every option you see
                a couple of options. The same pattern happens with every option and I think that makes it easier</p>
