        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Models:</b> are objects that implement the functionality for creating, reading, updating and deleting
                            (known as CRUD tasks) specific pieces of information about the application, as well as any other
                            associated logic and behavior. In a to-do list application, for example, there would be a task model
                            providing methods to access all the information about the tasks such as names, due dates and completed
                            tasks. This data will often be stored in a database or some other container.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Views:</b> provide a visual representation of the model showing all the relevant information. In a web
                            application, this would be the HTML displayed on a web page. Views also provide a way for users to
                            interact with an application, usually via forms. In a to-do list application, the views would display
                            the tasks as an HTML list with checkboxes that a user could tick to say a task had been completed.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Controllers:</b> link models and views together by communicating between them. They respond to events,
                            which are usually inputs from a user (entering some data into a form, for example), process the
                            information, then update the model and view accordingly. In a to-do list application, the controller
                            functions would respond to the event of a user clicking on a check box and then inform the model that a
                            task had been completed. The model would then update the information about that task.</li>
