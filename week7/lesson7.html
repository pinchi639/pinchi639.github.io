        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> AJAX is a set of web development techniques using many web technologies on the client-side to create
                asynchronous web applications.</li>
            <li>NEVER FORGET TO SINCRONIZE CHANGES TO GITHUB!!!!</li>
            <li>Ajax is not a single technology, but rather a group of technologies. </li>
            <li>
                Sometimes async = false are used for quick testing.
            </li>
            <li>Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar
                to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to
                qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious
                relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the
                scope from which you wish to call it</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Is AJAX the same as Javascript?
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Code Examples</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                / Initialize the HTTP request.<br>
                var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();<br>
                xhr.open('GET', 'send-ajax-data.php');<br>
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Function Example:<br>
                function myFunc(theObject) { <br>
                    theObject.make = 'Toyota';<br>
                  }<br>
                  <br>
                  var mycar = {make: 'Honda', model: 'Accord', year: 1998};<br>
                  var x, y;<br>
                  <br>
                  x = mycar.make; // x gets the value "Honda"<br>
                  <br>
                  myFunc(mycar);<br>
                  y = mycar.make; // y gets the value "Toyota"<br>
                                  // (the make property was changed by the function)<br>
            </li>
        </ol>
