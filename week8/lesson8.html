    <h3>Week 08</h3>

    <ul>


        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                CSS transitions allow you to animate something that may typically happen immediately.
                You can customize how it is animated and for how long.

            </li>
            <li>
                We first target the div in order to style it and give it a red color.
                When we target it again but use the :hover, it makes it transition to blue
                when the user hovers over it. The transition also has a clarification of 2s
                so that the transition happens over a span of 2 seconds.
            </li>

        </ol>

        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                How did you do the page animations going from one screen to another with
                the pokiAPI demo you showed in class?
            </li>

        </ol>

        <h3>Code Examples</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    div { <br>
                    width: 100px; <br>
                    height: 100px; <br>
                    color: red; <br>
                    transition: color 2s; <br>
                    } <br>

                    div:hover { <br>
                    color: blue; <br>
                    }
