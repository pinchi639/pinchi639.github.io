        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                CSS transitions allow you to animate something that may typically happen immediately.
                You can customize how it is animated and for how long.

            </li><br>
            <li>
                We first target the div in order to style it and give it a red color.
                When we target it again but use the :hover, it makes it transition to blue
                when the user hovers over it. The transition also has a clarification of 2s
                so that the transition happens over a span of 2 seconds.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Transitions are the grease in the wheel of CSS transforms. Without a transition, an element being
                transformed would change abruptly from one state to another. By applying a transition you can control
                the change, making it smooth and gradual.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                    There are two properties that are required in order for the transition to take effect:<br>

                    transition-property<br>
                    transition-duration
            </li><br>
            <li>
                    transforms = how to make an element change from one state to another.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                    Transforms are triggered when an element changes states, such as on mouse-hover or mouse-click.

                How did you do the page animations going from one screen to another with
                the pokiAPI demo you showed in class?

        <h3>Code Examples</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    div { <br>
                    width: 100px; <br>
                    height: 100px; <br>
                    color: red; <br>
                    transition: color 2s; <br>
                    } <br>

                    div:hover { <br>
                    color: blue; <br>
                    }
