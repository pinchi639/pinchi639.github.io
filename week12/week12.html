        <h3>Notes</h3>

        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                What is the best way to expose myself to real life experience and job opportunities? <br>
                I feel like school also creates like a comfort zone in the sense of "I am doing homework" <br>
                that should be enough to gain experience but in reality I feel like we need to be more exposed to <br>
                real jobs or real life professional opportunities.
