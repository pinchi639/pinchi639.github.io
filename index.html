    I am a convert in the church and I joined the church when I was 14 years old. I served a full time mission in Arequipa, Peru. I love traveling, and indeed, this year I have been to ten countries total with a friend.
    My second passion is food. I love eating and trying new dishes out. I love cooking and my favorite kind of food is italian. My italian favorite dish is gnocchi.
