                Debugging easy definition : the process of identifying and removing errors
                from computer hardware or software.
                This debugging process often takes a long time, as fixing some errors may 
                introduce others.

        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Is debugging really necessary for web developers?
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Code Examples</h3>

            <li>
                Callbacks are quite interesting. Is it possible to invoke as many callbacks
                as necessary in the same function? Can any callbacks be used inside other callbacks?
