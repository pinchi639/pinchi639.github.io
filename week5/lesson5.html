            <li>
              <p>  Debugging easy definition : the process of identifying and removing errors
                from computer hardware or software.<br>
                This debugging process often takes a long time, as fixing some errors may
                introduce others.
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Testing easy definition: Testing is the process to find bugs and errors.<br>
                *There is no need of design knowledge in the testing process.<br>
                *Testing can be manual or automated.<br>
                *Testing is initiated after the code is written.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Breakpoints: Breakpoints play an important role in debugging. <br>
                They pause (break) a program when it reaches a certain point.
            </li>

        </ol>

        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Is debugging knowledge really necessary for web developers?<br>
                Found the answer after going back and reading more: <br>
                Debugging is done by either programmer or developer.
