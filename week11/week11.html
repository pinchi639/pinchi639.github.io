                the scrollTo() method allows you to have the page take you to a specified

                    Here is the code for the two functions to make the scrollTo() methods work: <br>
                    function scrollBottom() { <br>
                    window.scrollTo(0,5000); <br>
                    } <br>
                    <br>
                    function scrollBack() { <br>
                    window.scrollTo(0,50); <br>
                    }
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
