    <h1>Some observations:</h1>
    <p>Unless the application is designed to “remember,"" it will not. This means that the programmer must tell the application exactly what and how to remember. This is basically the main idea of the local storage functionality</p>
    <p>Local storage will always be stored and accessed with a key value pair</p>

    <h1>Some questions:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>What does the placeholder attribute do? Which elements can use it?</li>
        <li>Is it normal to put the “story name” bit in front of the input tag without a tag?</li>
        <li>How can I center an element using simple CSS?</li>
        <li>When we are getting the data from the input or text area we use value, do all elements have values? If I were to get data from some other tag do I use value? Or a different identifier?</li>
        <li>What are the limits of the keys and values? Can they be any data type or do they have to be strings?</li>
        <li>How much local storage exists? What happens when it fills up?</li>
        <li>What are header, main, and footer tags for?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Most of the above questions are from the doing stuff with web things book's chapter on local storage. I have found answers to a few of them already.</p>
