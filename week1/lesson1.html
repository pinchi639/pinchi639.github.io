        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Not a lot of notes this week. Most time was spend making the portfolio page.
                One thing that stuck out to me during the reading that I never knew about but
                probably should have is that when calling a function from HTML you can pass in 'this'
                So that the calling function has information about what is calling the function.
            </li>

        </ol>

        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                How long am I going to have to spend studying for this class every week? Looks like a lot of work
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Code Examples</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Callbacks are quite interesting. Is it possible to invoke as many callbacks
                as necessary in the same function? Can any callbacks be used inside other callbacks?
            </li>
        </ol>
